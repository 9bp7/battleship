Improving computer attack logic
Current Downfalls
- Takes too long trying the surrounding coordinates after getting a successful hit
- To fix: In coordsToTry, store the relative direction of the potential coordinate, e.g. up/down/left/right
          If the direction was successful, store it in a variable to use next time
          If that direction is tried, without success, set the last successful direction to null
          Create a new array that shuffles but always puts the desired item (if not null), i.e. the one that matches the last successful direction, to the top so that it is tried first

- Continues to shoot at surrounding tiles of ships that have already been destroyed
- To fix: Get the coordinate of ships that have been sunk, and remove them from the successful coordinates list
